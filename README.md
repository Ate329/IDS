# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## **Introduction**

This project is a Django-based **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** designed to monitor, analyze, and detect anomalies in network traffic. It uses machine learning for anomaly detection and provides a web interface for real-time monitoring, configuration, and analysis.

The IDS leverages the **[NSL-KDD Feature Extractor](https://github.com/Ate329/NSL-KDD-feature-extractor)** to extract NSL-KDD dataset-compatible features from live network traffic. The feature extractor is already included in this project and does not need to be downloaded separately.

The dataset used for training the machine learning model is the **[NSL-KDD Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassan06/nslkdd/data)**.

**Currently the web interface is not working, any who can fix it can try to submit a PR for it. I'll try to work on a easy CLI for now**

## **Features**

1. **Real-Time Traffic Monitoring**
   - Capture live network traffic using `scapy`.
   - Extract detailed traffic features using the integrated [NSL-KDD Feature Extractor](https://github.com/Ate329/NSL-KDD-feature-extractor).

2. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Uses a pre-trained Random Forest model trained on the NSL-KDD dataset.
   - Features are normalized using a pre-trained scaler.

3. **Web-Based Interface**
   - Interactive dashboard with metrics for total, normal, and anomaly packets.
   - Visualizations for protocol and flag distribution, and 24-hour traffic trends.

4. **Configurable Settings**
   - Select network interface.
   - Enable/disable internal traffic detection.
   - Set up email alerts for anomalies.

5. **Logs and Data Export**
   - View and download traffic logs.
   - Export network traffic data to CSV for offline analysis.

6. **Maintenance Tools**
   - Clear logs, database records, and traffic data.
   - Manage scaler and machine learning model files.

## **Development Notes**

- The project integrates the **NSL-KDD Feature Extractor** for feature extraction, which is already included in this repository.
- Replace or update the machine learning model in `models/NSL-KDD-RF-model.joblib` to adapt to different datasets or requirements.
